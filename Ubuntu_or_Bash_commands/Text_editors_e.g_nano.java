If the `nano` text editor is not installed on your system and you'd like to use it, you can install it using the package manager `apt-get` in Ubuntu. Here's how:

1. **Update Package List**:
   Before installing any packages, it's a good practice to update the package list to make sure you're getting the latest version information. Run the following command:

   ```bash
   sudo apt-get update
   ```

2. **Install nano**:
   Use the following command to install the `nano` text editor:

   ```bash
   sudo apt-get install nano
   ```

   This will download and install the `nano` package.

3. **Run nano**:
   After installation, you can run `nano` to open the text editor. For example:

   ```bash
   nano my_script.sh
   ```

   Replace `my_script.sh` with the name of the script you want to create or edit.

Remember that you might need root (administrator) privileges to install packages using `sudo`. If you encounter any issues during installation, make sure you have appropriate permissions and that your system's package repositories are configured correctly.

If you prefer to use a different text editor, you can install `vim` (Vi IMproved) or `gedit` (GNOME Text Editor) using similar commands:

- For `vim`:
  ```bash
  sudo apt-get install vim
  ```

- For `gedit`:
  ```bash
  sudo apt-get install gedit
  ```

Choose the text editor that you are most comfortable with.
