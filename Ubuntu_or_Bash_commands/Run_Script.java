Yes, you can write and execute the script in Ubuntu. To do this, follow these steps:

1. **Open a Text Editor**: Open a text editor like `nano`, `vim`, or `gedit`. For example, let's use `nano`:

   ```bash
   nano my_script.sh
   ```

2. **Paste the Script**: Paste the script you provided into the text editor.

3. **Save and Exit**: Save the file by pressing `Ctrl + O` (to write out) and then press `Enter`. Then exit the text editor by pressing `Ctrl + X`.

4. **Make the Script Executable**: Before you can execute the script, you need to make it executable. Run the following command:

   ```bash
   chmod +x my_script.sh
   ```

   This command grants execute permissions to the script.

5. **Run the Script**: Now you can execute the script by running:

   ```bash
   ./my_script.sh
   ```

   The `./` is used to specify the current directory. This runs the script in the current directory.

6. **View Output**: After running the script, you'll see the output in the terminal. The script will create a `file_list.txt` file in the same directory containing the list of files and directories.

Remember to replace `my_script.sh` with the actual name you choose for your script. Also, ensure that you are in the same directory where the script is located when you execute it.

If you encounter permission issues when running the script, make sure you have the necessary permissions to execute files in that directory. If you're using `sudo`, be cautious as some commands in the script might not work as expected due to elevated privileges.
