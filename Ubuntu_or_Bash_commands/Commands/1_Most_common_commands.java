   - `rm`: Remove files and directories.
   - `find`: Search for files and directories.

2. **Text Manipulation**:

   - `grep`: Search for patterns in files.
   - `sed`: Stream editor for text manipulation.
   - `awk`: Text processing tool.
   - `echo`: Print text to the terminal.

3. **File Permissions**:

   - `chgrp`: Change group ownership.

4. **System Information**:
   - `uname`: Print system information.
   - `df`: Display disk space usage.
   - `free`: Display memory usage.
   - `top`: Display system information and processes.
   - `ps`: Display information about running processes.

   - `passwd`: Change user password.
   - `usermod`: Modify user attributes.
   - `groupadd`: Add a group.
   - `groupmod`: Modify group attributes.

8. **Process Management**:
   - `ps`: Display process status.
   - `top` or `htop`: Interactive process viewer.
   - `kill` or `pkill`: Terminate processes.
   - `jobs` and `fg`: Manage background jobs.

9. **Shell Scripting**:
   - `bash`: The default shell in Ubuntu.
   - `sh`: The Bourne shell.
   - `chmod +x script.sh`: Make a script executable.
   - `./script.sh`: Run a shell script.

The Ubuntu console (terminal) provides a shell interface where you can enter commands to interact with the system. The default shell in Ubuntu is usually the Bash shell (Bourne Again Shell). Bash is both a command-line interpreter (CLI) and a scripting language. When you run commands in the terminal, you're essentially using the Bash shell to execute those commands.

Bash scripting involves writing scripts that contain sequences of Bash commands and control structures, allowing you to automate tasks, perform system administration, and more. So, while the commands you use in the terminal are the same as those in Bash scripting, scripting extends the capabilities by allowing you to write scripts that execute multiple commands in a sequence.
