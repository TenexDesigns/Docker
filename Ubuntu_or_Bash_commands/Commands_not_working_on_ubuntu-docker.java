When working with Docker containers based on Ubuntu images, you might encounter limitations in terms of available software and tools compared to a full Ubuntu installation. This is because Docker containers are designed to be lightweight and isolated environments that contain only the necessary components for the specific tasks they are meant to perform. Here are a few points to consider:

1. **Minimal Installations**: Many official Docker images, including Ubuntu images, are often built with a minimal installation to keep the image size small and reduce the attack surface. This means that some tools and packages that you might expect to be available in a full Ubuntu installation might be missing by default.

2. **Package Managers**: Some Docker images might not include package managers like `apt-get` or `yum` because the container environment is meant to be immutable and consistent. However, many official images do include package managers to allow you to install additional software if needed.

3. **Custom Images**: If you require specific tools or software in your Docker container, you can create a custom Docker image by starting from a base image (like Ubuntu) and adding the necessary packages and configurations using Dockerfile instructions.

4. **Layering**: Docker images are built in layers, and each layer adds to the image's size. By minimizing the number of layers and avoiding unnecessary components, Docker images remain efficient and lightweight.

5. **Multi-Stage Builds**: For certain use cases, you might use multi-stage builds, where you build an application in one image and then copy the results into a smaller image for deployment. This approach can help reduce the size of the final image.

6. **Alpine Linux**: If size and efficiency are crucial, you might consider using Alpine Linux-based images. Alpine Linux is designed for minimalism and security, and its images are significantly smaller than those based on other distributions.

Keep in mind that the Docker container is meant to run a single application or service. While you can install additional software inside a container, it's important to consider the purpose of the container and avoid unnecessary complexity.

If you find that you need specific tools that are not available in an existing image, you can create your own Docker image by starting from a suitable base image (like Ubuntu) and adding the required packages using the Dockerfile. This way, you can tailor the container to your application's needs while keeping it lightweight and efficient.
