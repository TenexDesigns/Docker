Named volumes work in a similar way to host volumes, but they are stored in a central location on the Docker host. This means that they are easier to manage and share between containers.

When you create a named volume, Docker creates a directory on the host machine and assigns it a unique name. You can then mount this named volume to any container that you want.

To replicate the host volume that you mentioned, you would first need to create a named volume. You can do this using the `docker volume create` command:

```
docker volume create my-volume
```

Once you have created the named volume, you can mount it to a container using the `-v` flag:

```
docker run --name myapp_c_nodemon -p 4000:4000 --rm -v my-volume:/app  myapp:nodemon
```

This will mount the named volume `my-volume` to the container at `/app`. Any changes made to the files in the named volume will be reflected in the container at `/app`.

Here are some additional things to keep in mind about named volumes:

* Named volumes are persistent, which means that the data in the volume will not be lost when the container is stopped or deleted.
* Named volumes can be shared by multiple containers.
* Named volumes can be managed using the Docker CLI or the Docker API.

I hope this helps!

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

When using named volumes, Docker creates a directory on the host machine to store the volume data. When you mount the named volume into a container, this directory is what is mounted into the container . 

To create a named volume, you can use the `docker volume create` command followed by the name of the volume you want to create . Here is an example:

```
docker volume create my-named-volume
```

Once you have created a named volume, you can mount it into a container using the `-v` flag followed by the name of the volume and the path where you want to mount it in the container . Here is an example:

```
docker run --name my-container -v my-named-volume:/path/in/container my-image
```

In this example, `my-named-volume` is the name of the named volume that you want to mount into your container. The `:/path/in/container` part specifies the mountpoint in the container where you want to mount the volume . 

When you make changes to files in the named volume on the host machine, those changes will be reflected in the container and vice versa. This is because the named volume is mounted as a directory in both places .
