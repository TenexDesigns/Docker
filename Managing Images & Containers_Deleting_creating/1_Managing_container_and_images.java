Certainly! Here are some Docker commands to help you manage images and containers:

**Managing Images:**
1. `docker images`: List all images on your system.
2. `docker images -a`: List all images, including intermediate layers.
3. `docker rmi <image_name>`: Remove an image.
4. `docker rmi $(docker images -q)`: Remove all images.
5. `docker pull <image_name>`: Pull an image from a registry.
6. `docker push <image_name>`: Push an image to a registry.
7. `docker save -o <file_name>.tar <image_name>`: Save an image as a tar archive.
8. `docker load -i <file_name>.tar`: Load an image from a tar archive.
9. `docker history <image_name>`: Display the history of an image's layers.
10. `docker inspect <image_name>`: Display detailed information about an image.
11. `docker build -t <image_name> .`: Build an image with a specific name and tag using a Dockerfile.
12. `docker image prune`: Remove all dangling images.

**Managing Containers:**
1. `docker ps`: List all running containers.
2. `docker ps -a`: List all containers (including stopped ones).
3. `docker rm <container_name>`: Remove a stopped container.
4. `docker rm $(docker ps -a -q)`: Remove all stopped containers.
5. `docker start <container_name>`: Start a stopped container.
6. `docker stop <container_name>`: Stop a running container.
7. `docker restart <container_name>`: Restart a container.
8. `docker pause <container_name>`: Pause all processes within a container.
9. `docker unpause <container_name>`: Unpause a paused container.
10. `docker exec -it <container_name> <command>`: Run a command within a running container in interactive mode.
11. `docker logs <container_name>`: View the logs of a container.
12. `docker inspect <container_name>`: Display detailed information about a container.
13. `docker top <container_name>`: Display the running processes in a container.
14. `docker stats <container_name>`: Display live performance statistics of a container.
15. `docker rename <old_name> <new_name>`: Rename a container.
16. `docker update --cpus <number> <container_name>`: Update the CPU share of a container.
17. `docker update --memory <amount> <container_name>`: Update the memory limit of a container.

These commands will help you manage your Docker images and containers effectively. Make sure to replace `<image_name>` and `<container_name>` with the actual names or IDs of the images and containers you want to manage. Additionally, always be cautious when removing images or containers, as they might contain important data.

Sure, I can help you with that.

Here are some of the commands you can use to manage Docker images and containers:

**Managing images**

* `docker image ls`: List all Docker images.
* `docker image build`: Build a Docker image from a Dockerfile.
* `docker image inspect`: Get detailed information about a Docker image.
* `docker image pull`: Pull a Docker image from a registry.
* `docker image push`: Push a Docker image to a registry.
* `docker image tag`: Tag a Docker image with a new name or alias.
* `docker image rmi`: Remove a Docker image.

**Managing containers**

* `docker container ls`: List all Docker containers.
* `docker container run`: Run a Docker container.
* `docker container stop`: Stop a Docker container.
* `docker container start`: Start a Docker container.
* `docker container restart`: Restart a Docker container.
* `docker container kill`: Kill a Docker container.
* `docker container rm`: Remove a Docker container.

Here are some additional commands that you may find useful:

* `docker image prune`: Remove all unused Docker images.
* `docker container prune`: Remove all stopped Docker containers.
* `docker system prune`: Remove all unused Docker images, containers, and networks.

To learn more about these commands, you can refer to the Docker documentation: https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/cli/.

Here are some examples of how to use these commands:

* To list all Docker images, you would run the following command:

```
docker image ls
```

* To build a Docker image from a Dockerfile, you would run the following command:

```
docker image build -t my-image .
```

* To get detailed information about a Docker image, you would run the following command:

```
docker image inspect my-image
```

* To pull a Docker image from a registry, you would run the following command:

```
docker image pull ubuntu:latest
```

* To push a Docker image to a registry, you would run the following command:

```
docker image push my-image
```

* To tag a Docker image with a new name or alias, you would run the following command:

```
docker image tag my-image my-new-image
```

* To remove a Docker image, you would run the following command:

```
docker image rmi my-image
```

* To run a Docker container, you would run the following command:

```
docker container run -it ubuntu:latest
```

* To stop a Docker container, you would run the following command:

```
docker container stop my-container
```

* To start a Docker container, you would run the following command:

```
docker container start my-container
```

* To restart a Docker container, you would run the following command:

```
docker container restart my-container
```

* To kill a Docker container, you would run the following command:

```
docker container kill my-container
```

* To remove a Docker container, you would run the following command:

```
docker container rm my-container
```

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.
