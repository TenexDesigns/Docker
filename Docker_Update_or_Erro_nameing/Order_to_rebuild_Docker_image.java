You should make the changes first, then rebuild the Docker image with the corrected code, and finally remove the old container and image. Here's the correct sequence of steps:

1. **Make Changes**: Correct the filename in your code or Dockerfile.

2. **Rebuild the Image**: Build the new Docker image with the corrected code:

   ```bash
   docker build -t docker .
   ```

3. **Remove Old Container and Image**: After you've successfully built the new image, stop and remove the old container and image:

   ```bash
   docker stop old_docker_container   # Stop the old container
   docker rm old_docker_container     # Remove the old container
   docker rmi old_docker_image        # Remove the old image
   ```

   Here, replace `old_docker_container` and `old_docker_image` with the actual names or IDs of your old container and image.

4. **Run New Container**: Finally, run a new container based on the updated image:

   ```bash
   docker run docker
   ```

This sequence ensures that you're working with the updated code and image without any conflicts from the old container or image.
