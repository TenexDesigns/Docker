If you've already built an image with the incorrect filename (`app.js` instead of `index.js`) and you want to correct it, you'll need to make the necessary changes in your code or Dockerfile and then rebuild the image. Here's what you can do:

1. **Update the Code or Dockerfile**: Correct the filename from `app.js` to `index.js` either in your application code or in the `CMD` instruction of the Dockerfile, wherever the filename is referenced.

2. **Rebuild the Image**: Once you've made the necessary changes, rebuild the Docker image using the corrected Dockerfile. Run the following commands in your terminal:

   ```bash
   docker build -t docker .
   ```

   This will recreate the image with the corrected filename.

3. **Remove the Old Container and Image**: Since you've already run the container using the incorrect image, you should stop and remove the old container and image. Replace `docker` with the actual name or ID of your old container/image. Use the following commands:

   ```bash
   docker stop docker   # Stop the old container
   docker rm docker     # Remove the old container
   docker rmi docker    # Remove the old image
   ```

   Here, `docker stop` stops the container, `docker rm` removes the container, and `docker rmi` removes the image.

4. **Run the New Container**: After removing the old container and image, you can run a new container based on the updated image:

   ```bash
   docker run docker
   ```

Remember that Docker images and containers are immutable once created. If you need to make changes, you typically need to update your code or Dockerfile, rebuild the image, and then run containers based on the new image.
