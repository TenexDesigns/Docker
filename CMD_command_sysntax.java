The syntax you're referring to, such as `CMD ["python3", "app.py"]` and `CMD ["nginx", "-g", "daemon off;"]`, is used to define the default command that will be executed when a container based on the Docker image starts.

In Docker, there are two formats for specifying the command to be executed:

1. **Shell Form**: This is the more familiar format that runs the command through a shell interpreter (like `/bin/sh`).

   Example: `CMD python3 app.py`

2. **Exec Form**: This is the JSON array format, as in `CMD ["python3", "app.py"]`, where each element is a separate word of the command.

   This form is often preferred for several reasons:
   - It doesn't invoke a shell by default, which can help avoid certain unexpected behaviors or security risks.
   - It allows passing arguments to the command more clearly.
   - It can be more reliable when dealing with commands that have spaces or special characters.

So, in the example you provided:

1. `CMD ["python3", "app.py"]`: This specifies that when a container starts based on the image, it will directly execute the command `python3 app.py`. It assumes that `app.py` is a Python script in the container's working directory.

2. `CMD ["nginx", "-g", "daemon off;"]`: This specifies that when a container starts, it will run the command `nginx -g "daemon off;"`. This is often used with Nginx to start it in the foreground, allowing the container to keep running while Nginx serves requests. The `-g` flag is used to provide configuration directives to Nginx.

In both cases, the command specified in the `CMD` instruction determines the primary process running in the container. When that process exits, the container will also stop. This is why, in the case of something like a web server (e.g., Nginx), using `daemon off;` helps keep the container running as the primary process doesn't exit immediately.
